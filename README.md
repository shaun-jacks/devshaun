## Extra Features

In addition, the user has the ability to comment on articles and can login via Facebook.

This is where most of the backend logic comes into play.

## Motivation

I made this website for two primary reasons:

- I wanted a single hub that can act as both a log of my journey in Data Science and Software Development, and a place where others could learn from my personal experience.

- I wanted to dive into the code and build something myself in order to both learn, and feel a sense of pride and ownership for this project.
